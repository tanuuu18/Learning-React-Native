# Expo vs React Native
<ul>
  <li>React Native is an open-source framework maintained by Meta(Facebook), designed for building cross-platform apps.</li>
<li>Expo is an open-source framework maintained by Expo itself, designed for building cross-platform apps.</li>
<li>Unlike plain React Native, which can be challenging and time-consuming to set up, Expo provides a streamlined experience.</li>
  <li>
  Expo has a suite of tools and services built around React Native, which greatly simplifies the development process.</li>
  <li>With plain react native, you cannot build iOS apps on a windows or linux machine. Native iOS apps can only be built on a macOS machine.</li>
 <li>With Expo, you can devlop your app on windows or linux and run your app on a physical iPhone.</li>
</ul>

# Expo
<ul>
  <li>Expo has evolved significantly over the years and now supports nearly all the features necessary for building mobile apps.</li>
<li>In the event that you require access to native Android or iOS code, Expo allows you to eject your app and work with a plain React Native codebase.</li>

</ul>
